## Linksls

* If you don't have access to Claude, everyone should have a chance to try it. You can use this [link](https://tools.simonwillison.net/encrypt#2JKlrMj2CEZO3jXh5KvO7eZTrgS5F6Y6QkDQUVo+3/TOVAaIltMAOdONZnZp6put7MtO9b3yax+HPrfgR7whhkMaXIZ8dizoc1j5DuQ8AxfMf4yXraBBrgLhBRvfFgnmHiSRrMvknArrSrnAxP/Oob2UIaSqcZJSdiEXYOESqQpyuisfCT5d/j85gXOluFi6aXO9XyCmpu0=) to get a Claude API key, which will allow you to use Claude code. Only for students that don't have a claude Pro account, I've put $30 on it, but that is for all those students to share. Ask Bill for the passphrase.

* [The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI](https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington) Cory Doctorow is worth following. I find his science fiction books interesting, and he has popularized the term enshittification to describe why many on-line experiences have grown shittier. I don't pay too much attention so some of the harsh AI critics, but Cory's critque is at worth reading, even if I dont' agree with all of it.

## Work in class

We decided we wanted to focus our last class on discussion, rather than coding.
