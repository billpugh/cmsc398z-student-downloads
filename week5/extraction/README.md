# Data extraction project

## Getting started

We provided the following files from the documentation for this week in this folder as references for both yourself and any AI agent.

* [setup.md](setup.md)
* [prompting.md](prompting.md)
* [prompting-python.md](prompting-python.md)
* [week5-project.md](week5-project.md)]

Go through the steps described in setup.md to create your venv, activated it, and get and set your API key, and set your default model to be gpt-5-mini.

Once you've done that, use the `llm` command to prompt gpt-5-mini, and verify that it works.

## Going through the material

Go through the [UMD version of Simon's pycon workshop](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2025/cmsc398z/weeks/week05/)

There are plenty of examples to try in both [prompting.md](prompting.md) and [prompting-python.md](prompting-python.md). 

## Doing the projects for week 5

There are 4 different data sources you can extract from, you can work on any subset of them. The [week5-project.md](week5-project.md) file describes them and several steps you can take in examining them. You can choose to do a deep dive on just one, or explore several of them.

Update [Results.md](Readme.md) with the results of your analysis. Submit that and any code you wrote for your analysis and any output you wish to share from your analysis.
