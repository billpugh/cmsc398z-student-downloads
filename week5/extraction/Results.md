# Week 5 results

As described on the [web page for the week 5 project](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2025/cmsc398z/weeks/week05/week5-project.html), write down the results of your experimentation and evaluation of using LLMs to extract data from the 4 data sources described on the web page.

You can work on any non-empty subset of these datasources, it is up to you. For each one, [write up what you found](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2025/cmsc398z/weeks/week05/week5-project.html#writing-up-what-you-found) as described in that document.

If you wish to submit any python files or output as part of your description of what you did for that data source, list them and describe them in the appropriate section.
