[Our version of Simon's Pycon workshop](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2025/cmsc398z/weeks/week07)

## Submission of work for this week

In the databases project folder, modify [studentWork.md](databases/studentWork.md) with the following information, and submit it via the submit server.

* A question you asked about the course database, your experience getting valid SQL to get that data, and what you learned from the results.
* A question you asked about the course database using embeddings, and what you learned from the results.

If you have additional files that contain things such as your question, generated SQL and results, it would be good to
submit those as well and reference those from studentWork.md.
