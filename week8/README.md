# CMSC 398Z - Week 8 - Oct 24th, 2025

## Coding projects

### Project 8a - [Datebases](databases)

## Work in class

* [Getting set up in Claude](gettingSetUpInClaude.md)

* [WordSearch directions](wordSearch.md)
    [wordSearch directory](wordSearch)

* [Modifying the idle editor distributed with Python](modifyingIdle.md)

* If you have time for it, start looking at 
[congressionalReview.md](congressionalReview.md). We are going to be spending more time on that next week. 

## Submission of work for this week

In the databases project folder, modify [studentWork.md](databases/studentWork.md) with the following information, and submit it via the submit server.

* A question you asked about the course database, your experience getting valid SQL to get that data, and what you learned from the results.
* A question you asked about the course database using embeddings, and what you learned from the results.

If you have additional files that contain things such as your question, generated SQL and results, it would be good to
submit those as well and reference those from studentWork.md.
